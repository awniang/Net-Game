The game net is a single-player logic puzzle.

The game consists of a 5x5 grid with squares containing pieces, comparable to cables or pipes, which can be rotated by a quarter turn in the clockwise (or anti-clockwise) direction. These pieces have a certain shape (endpoint, segment, corner, or tee) and a certain orientation (N, E, S, W). Each shape consists of one or more arms, connected to the center of the square, called half-edges.
